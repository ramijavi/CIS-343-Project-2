# CIS-343-Project-2

Authors: Javier Ramirez & Andy Hung

In this project we will create a very simple programming language. This language will be called Zoomjoystrong and it will be written in C, with the help of Flex and Bison. As such, we will need the following pieces:

  - A Flex file to define our tokens. We will call this zoomjoystrong.lex.
  - A Bison file to define our grammar. This will be called zoomjoystrong.y.
  - A graphics library with functions we can call to do the drawing. This will be provided to you in files called zoomjoystrong.h and zoomjoystrong.c.

The grapichs library is provided.
